  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p> Progressive enchancement is a developmental approach that buils off a reliable but simple foundation. 
    You start off using basic HTML then layer in CSS for styling and JavaScript for a more reactive website. 
    The enhancements are optional and if a browser does not support certain features, the users still get a working website.
    Progressive enchancement is important as it allows for performance optimization. This can lead to less lag if people had poor connections whichs allows for the website to run and load faster.

  <h2>Rover Final Project Reflection</h2>
  <p> For the first rendition of the project or the first draft, I mainly focused on getting most of the requirements put on the page.
    I wasn't really focused on the style so long as it worked, which, seemed to be the main goal of this project for me which was getting it to work perfectly and have it fully validated.
    When I first showed my project off to others, mostly my family, they were impressed and supportive but when asked for criticsm it came off a bit harsh.
    The most constructive piece of criticsm that I was given was that it looked like unstylized and unorder google document despite the information being organized.
  </p>

  <p>
    Looking back at the rough draft and comparing and it from the first prototype, I realized it looked no different from the project we did which was designing an informative UALR page.
    While there was advances features, it felt as if I hadn't improved from where I first began, in which I feel, shouldn't be.
    There is suppose to be some type of visible improvement as with just about anything done in life such as working or or doing art.
    In other words, the work I done felt complacent. Just enough to get by which did not feel good.
  </p>

  <p>
  So I ended up focusing on the style of the page, which was something I wasn't as familiar with compared to html for the final project, I believe it looks good.
  It was a good motivator and improvement for me and my mindset. At times it can be hard to push away from being complacent in your skill, even when you are doing something that most others can't.
  With no motivation, or goal, or seeing hindsight of things, it can be easy to fall in the catagory the mindest of good enough. Not to say it's  bad mindset but I shouldn't have it when I'm learning something new.
  That is my biggest take away from doing this project.
