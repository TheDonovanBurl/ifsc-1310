  <h2>Why Explore Mars?</h2>
  <p>Mars is the most Earth-like world in our solar system and a natural target for scientific exploration. Its ancient riverbeds, minerals formed in water, and preserved geological history offer a unique window into the early solar system. By studying Mars, NASA hopes to uncover clues about the planet’s past and its potential to support life.</p>
  <p>Exploring Mars provides several key scientific and engineering benefits:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Search for Ancient Life:</strong>
      Mars once had liquid water, a thicker atmosphere, and warmer temperatures. These conditions may have supported microbial life billions of years ago. Rovers analyze rock layers and minerals to search for biosignatures.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Understand Planetary Evolution:</strong>
      Mars helps scientists compare how Earth-like planets evolve over time. Its surface preserves ancient features that have been erased on Earth by plate tectonics, weather, and erosion.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Study Climate and Atmosphere:</strong>
      Rovers and orbiters monitor dust storms, temperatures, radiation levels, and atmospheric chemistry—critical knowledge for future crewed missions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prepare for Human Exploration:</strong>
      Technologies such as autonomous navigation, sample caching, and oxygen production (like Perseverance’s MOXIE experiment) help pave the way for astronauts to live and work on Mars.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Advance Robotics and AI:</strong>
      Each rover becomes more autonomous than the last, testing new mobility systems, hazard detection algorithms, and communication methods for deep-space missions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Learn About Earth’s Past:</strong>
      Early Mars may have resembled early Earth. Understanding its transformation helps scientists better understand the conditions that shaped our own planet.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Together, these objectives drive NASA’s ongoing commitment to exploring Mars and expanding our knowledge of the universe. Each rover mission builds on the discoveries of previous missions, moving us closer to answering one of humanity’s biggest questions: <em>Are we alone?</em></p>
